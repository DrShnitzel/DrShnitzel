# Aleksei Zaitsev - ruby backend engineer

## My self-summary

Hi! I am Aleksei

For more than 12 years I am helping startups to grow big and handle technical issues that are coming with it.

I have always been passionate about technology. And have vast knowledge in many IT-related areas.

I am a problem solver if something is working slow, or there is a memory leak or something I can dig into it and help colleagues solve the problem. It's because I know how things work on a low level, and if I don't know something I am not afraid to read source code or documentation.

I like things simple. I prefer not to use huge frameworks with tons of magic. And when I use something, I like to check the source code. When I do not need SQL, I do not use it, sometimes key-value storage or even just a file is all you need.

I have been working remotely for more than 12 years and I have good self-organization skills. My employers like that I am a reliable and punctual person. I have never missed a deadline.
