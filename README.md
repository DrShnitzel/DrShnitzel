## My self-summary

I am experienced backend developer with more than 6 years of commercial development experience. My main language is Ruby but I am not limited to it. I have used many other technologies in my projects(Go, Rust, Objective-C, Swift, Python, Delphi etc.) and always looking forward to try something new.

I am reliable and punctual person. I have never missed a deadline
