# Aleksei Zaitsev - ruby backend engineer

## My self-summary

I am experienced backend developer with more than 7 years of commercial development experience. My main language is Ruby but I am not limited to it. I have used many other technologies in my projects(Go, Objective-C, Swift, Python etc.) and always looking forward to trying something new.

My employers like that I am a reliable and punctual person. I have never missed a deadline. Also, I am a problem solver, if something
is working slow, or there is a memory leak or something I can dig into it and help colleagues solve the problem.

## What I’ve worked on

I’ve been involved in more than 50 commercial projects for such well-known companies like Nestle, Oral-B, Loreal etc.(On all these projects I was an architect and developer). I wrote either APIs and 3D iOs games. My most interesting project was a social network for Bond Street(Philip and Morris), it has a half million of users, chats, games(with multiplayer), mailing and a lot of updates every single week.

At my current position, I am working on mvno(mobile virtual network operator) personal cabinets. Interesting thing here that I build it on docker and custom deployment system, which allows us to support only one application(but with different designs and on different server infrastructure). Also, it has centralized log system based on the ELK stack.

## What I’m looking to do next

I want to work with high loaded systems. I prefer to work remotely from Russia, but if it's a good offer I can relocate. I have worked remotely more than 7 years and I have good self-organization skills.
