## My self-summary

I am really passioned with technology! I like all kinds of it. From arduino to mobile apps. But most of all I like to write server code. I like to study everything new, right now I am learning Go to write more concurrent and faster apps.

## What I’ve worked on

I’ve been involved in more than 50 commercial projects for such well known companies like Nestle, Oral-B, Loreal etc. I wrote ether APIs and 3D iOs games. My most interesting project was social network for Bond Street(Philip and Morris), it has a half million of users, chats, games(with multiplayer), mailing and a lot of updates every single week.
