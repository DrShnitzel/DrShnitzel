## My self-summary

Hi! I am Aleksei

For more than 12 years I am helping startups to grow big and handle technical issues that are coming with it.

I have always been passionate about technology. And have vast knowledge in many IT-related areas.

I like optimizing things. If something is working slow, or there is a memory leak or something I can dig into it and help colleagues solve the problem. It's because I know how things work on a low level, and if I don't know something I am not afraid to read source code or documentation.

It's not only related to technologies. I like to optimize working process as well. Fighting cargo cults and reducing the number of unnesseray meetings(or sometimes inroducing something new). Here helps my expirience of working in vast number of different companies from small startups to big tech companies with thousands of workers.

Altough I prefer to work on technical issues I am capable of managing people. I am the one who helps team to communicate and not lose focus when team lead is on vacation. Also I have expirience in orginising people to build awesome products. e.g. opensource Google Authentificator replacement [SOTP Authentificator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sotp-authenticator/id1526068202)) and flashcard app for memorization [sAnki](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/sanki-app/id1637674445)

I have been working remotely for more than 12 years and I have good self-organization skills. My employers like that I am a reliable and punctual person.

I live in Armenia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡². I am foodie, armchair expert, ex catâ€™s slave. I like games, anime, tech, politics and stonks ðŸ¦§ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²ðŸš€ðŸŒ•.
