# Aleksei Zaitsev - ruby backend engineer

## My self-summary

I am experienced backend developer(with some DevOps skills) with more than 10 years of commercial development experience. My main language is Ruby but I am not limited to it. I have used many other technologies in my projects(Go, Objective-C, Python etc.) and always looking forward to trying something new.

I am a problem solver if something is working slow, or there is a memory leak or something I can dig into it and help colleagues solve the problem. It's because I know how things work on a low level, and if I don't know something I am not afraid to read source code or documentation.

I can solve any technical task, even if I am not familiar with the technology. For example, once I have written ios 3d game(Objective-C) in 2 months without any prior mobile or 3d experience.

I like things simple. I prefer not to use huge frameworks with tons of magic. And when I use something, I like to check the source code. When I do not need SQL, I do not use it, sometimes key-value storage or even just a file is all you need. When you understand how it works on a low level it is easy to write robust applications.

My employers like that I am a reliable and punctual person. I have never missed a deadline.

## What I’ve worked on
I’ve been involved in more than 50 commercial projects as a backend developer or architect. Including HR platform with millions of users(worki.ru), social network (bondstreet), MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) services, docker based deployment system and more

## What I’m looking to do next

I want to work with high loaded systems. I prefer to work remotely from Russia, but if it's a good offer I can relocate. I have been working remotely for more than 10 years and I have good self-organization skills.
