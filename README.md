## My Self-Summary

Hi! I am Aleksei.

For over 12 years, I have been helping startups grow and handle the technical issues that come with their growth.

I have always been passionate about technology and possess extensive knowledge in many IT-related areas.

I enjoy optimizing things. If something is running slowly or there's a memory leak, I can dive into it and help my colleagues solve the problem. This is because I understand how things work at a low level, and if I don't know something, I'm not afraid to read source code or documentation.

This isn't just related to technologies; I also like optimizing work processes. I fight cargo cults and reduce the number of unnecessary meetings (sometimes by introducing something new). My experience in working with a vast number of different companies, from small startups to large tech companies with thousands of employees, helps with this.

Although I prefer to work on technical issues, I am capable of managing people. I'm the one who helps the team communicate and stay focused when the team lead is on vacation. I also have experience in organizing people to build awesome products, such as the open-source Google Authenticator replacement [SOTP Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sotp-authenticator/id1526068202) and a flashcard app for memorization called [sAnki](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/sanki-app/id1637674445).

I have been working remotely for more than 12 years and possess good self-organization skills. My employers appreciate that I am a reliable and punctual person.

I live in Armenia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡². I am a foodie, an armchair expert, and a former cat's slave. I enjoy games, anime, tech, politics, and stonks ðŸ¦§ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²ðŸš€ðŸŒ•.

I thoroughly enjoy working in an international and multicultural team. It's an amazing experience that enhances both personal growth and team collaboration. Some of the things I've accomplished here:
